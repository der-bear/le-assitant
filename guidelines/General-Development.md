# General Development Guidelines

## File Management

### File Creation and Editing
- **NEVER** call edit_tool immediately after generating or regenerating a file
- For substantial edits (>30% of file), prefer re-creating the file entirely
- For localized edits (<30% of file), use edit_tool with sufficient context (3-5 lines before/after)
- Break complex edits into multiple edit_tool calls when possible

### File Structure
- Always use `/App.tsx` as the main component file name
- `/App.tsx` must have a default export
- Organize components in logical directories under `/components`
- Keep related functionality together

## Code Quality

### Best Practices
- Always include the full solution - no placeholders like "// Rest of the code remains the same"
- Refactor code as you go to keep it clean
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Use TypeScript properly with appropriate types

### Component Architecture
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use React hooks appropriately
- Minimize prop drilling - consider context for deeply nested state

### Performance
- Use React.memo() for expensive re-rendering components  
- Implement proper dependency arrays for useEffect and useMemo
- Avoid creating objects/functions in render methods

## API Integration

### External APIs
- Create mock/stub responses for APIs that require real credentials
- Use placeholder values for API keys (e.g., "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
- Include comments explaining how to replace placeholders with real credentials
- Use example data structures that match expected API response formats

### Data Handling
- Create mock data where needed to make applications look complete
- Use realistic sample data for demonstrations
- Structure data to match real-world API patterns

## Content Guidelines

### Copyright and Trademarks
- Unless user specifically asks, avoid content that might violate copyright/trademark laws
- Use generic examples and placeholder content
- Reference common, well-known examples when needed

### Internationalization
- Respond in the same language as the user's request
- Use appropriate date/time formats for the context
- Consider accessibility and screen readers

## Layout and Responsiveness

### Responsive Design Principles
- Use Flexbox and CSS Grid by default
- Only use absolute positioning when necessary
- Make applications responsive unless it doesn't make sense
- Consider mobile-first design approach

### Common Layout Patterns
```tsx
// Full height container
<div className="min-h-screen">

// Centered content
<div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">

// Responsive grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

// Flex layouts
<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
<div className="flex flex-row space-x-4">
```

## Error Handling

### User Experience
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle loading states appropriately
- Include fallback UI for failed states
- Use proper form validation

### Development
- Use TypeScript for better error catching
- Handle async operations properly
- Provide console logging for debugging when helpful

## Accessibility

### ARIA and Semantic HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements when possible
- Provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Include focus management for modals/dialogs

### Visual Design
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Provide text alternatives for images
- Ensure text is readable at different zoom levels

## Current Context

- Today's date: Saturday, August 9, 2025
- Environment: Figma Make web application builder
- Tech stack: React + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- Component library: ShadCN/UI available

## Security Considerations

- Never expose real API keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Don't collect PII without explicit user consent
- Consider HTTPS-only for production applications
- Validate user inputs appropriately

## Testing Considerations

While not implementing tests directly, consider:
- Writing testable code with clear inputs/outputs
- Separating business logic from UI components
- Using predictable component APIs
- Avoiding deeply nested component trees
